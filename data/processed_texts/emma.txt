['CHAPTER I\n\nEmma Woodhouse, handsome, clever, and rich, with a comfortable home and\nhappy disposition, seemed to unite some of the best blessings of\nexistence; and had lived nearly twenty-one years in the world with very\nlittle to distress or vex her.', 'She was the youngest of the two daughters of a most affectionate,\nindulgent father; and had, in consequence of her sister’s marriage,\nbeen mistress of his house from a very early period.', 'Her mother had\ndied too long ago for her to have more than an indistinct remembrance\nof her caresses; and her place had been supplied by an excellent woman\nas governess, who had fallen little short of a mother in affection.', 'Sixteen years had Miss Taylor been in Mr. Woodhouse’s family, less as a\ngoverness than a friend, very fond of both daughters, but particularly\nof Emma.', 'Between _them_ it was more the intimacy of sisters.', 'Even\nbefore Miss Taylor had ceased to hold the nominal office of governess,\nthe mildness of her temper had hardly allowed her to impose any\nrestraint; and the shadow of authority being now long passed away, they\nhad been living together as friend and friend very mutually attached,\nand Emma doing just what she liked; highly esteeming Miss Taylor’s\njudgment, but directed chiefly by her own.', 'The real evils, indeed, of Emma’s situation were the power of having\nrather too much her own way, and a disposition to think a little too\nwell of herself; these were the disadvantages which threatened alloy to\nher many enjoyments.', 'The danger, however, was at present so\nunperceived, that they did not by any means rank as misfortunes with\nher.', 'Sorrow came—a gentle sorrow—but not at all in the shape of any\ndisagreeable consciousness.—Miss Taylor married.', 'It was Miss Taylor’s\nloss which first brought grief.']
